**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

The best way to ensure that my code is functional and secure would be to test the code properly. You can not always test for everything but knowing what possible issues will be while creating the code and using user requirements and documentation can be very usueful in testing is most important in the code.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I interpret user needs and incorperate them into a program by first finding out what the user actually needs vs what they want, and document these needs into user requirements. Then to incorperate them into a program the user requirements are broken down to a point where I can code each part of my program exactly along the lines of the user requirements. Then I can also use the users needs and the code that I wrote to create tests for the code. Writing good tests for the code is extreamly important when trying to deliever the best possible end product to the user, and also helps in staying in a budget so there are less missed errors or defects that need to be revisited and corrected.

**How do I approach designing software?**

My appproach to designing software is a test based approach. What this means is I use the user requirements to come up with test cases before the software is finished, and using tests through out the whole process to as the software is being developed I catch as many errors or defects as possible. This saves me from having to correct errors after the software is already developed and also leaves me with a better eend product to deliever to the user or customer.
